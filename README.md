# GeoQuizz
GeoQuizz Is a small project for WWDC2022 by **Edoardo Troianiello**
GeoQuizz is a quiz app completely written using just SwiftUI and Foundation as frameworks. The application was implemented using the MVVM pattern in order to separate the application logic and the UI views, but also to showcase how with just SwiftUI and Playground app you are able also to deliver a professional-like product.
